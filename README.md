# ABAQUS python script for Stamping analysis
This is a python script for stamping analysis, I worked on this script on the Data Science for Materials and Manufacturing course at UCONN. I just modified the code for the purpose of the course project. The main body had been developed by the insteructor.

The model is symmetric about x axis, so we can simplify the analysis to +x axis.
